Problem :  A function that returns true if this Binary Tree is height balanced and false if it isn't in C++
Issue Number : #1368

IMP defination: 
A height balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the height of the left subtree and right subtree of any node
does not differ by more than 1 and both the left and right subtree are also height balanced.

Explanation of the below C++ code :
1. For each node make two recursion calls â€“ one for left subtree and the other for the right subtree. 
2. Based on the heights returned from the recursion calls, decide if the subtree whose root is the current node is height-balanced or not. 
3. If it is balanced then return the height of that subtree. Otherwise, return -1 to denote that the subtree is not height-balanced.

Base Condition
No node Hence no root node
If string contain all different characters, then minimum n-1 cuts are needed as by atleast

Time Complexity: O(n) 
Because we are only one dfs call and utilizing the height returned from that to determine the height balance,
it is performing the task in linear time.

Auxiliary Space: O(n)
